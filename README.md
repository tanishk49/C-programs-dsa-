# Data Structures and Algorithms in C 🚀

Welcome to my **DSA in C** repository!  
This repository is dedicated to learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using the **C programming language**. It contains a collection of commonly used data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques, all implemented in C.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

This repo includes C programs and implementations for:

- 🔁 **Basic Programming Constructs**
  - Loops, functions, recursion
- 🧵 **Arrays and Strings**
  - Searching and sorting
  - String manipulation
- 📊 **Linked Lists**
  - Singly, Doubly, and Circular
- 🌲 **Stacks and Queues**
  - Array-based and Linked List-based
- 🌳 **Trees**
  - Binary Trees, BST, Tree traversals
- 🛤 **Graphs**
  - Representations, BFS, DFS
- 💡 **Algorithms**
  - Searching and sorting (Linear, Binary, Quick, Merge, etc.)
  - Recursion and backtracking
  - Greedy and dynamic programming
- 🧠 **Other Concepts**
  - Pointers
  - Memory management
  - Bitwise operations
